## About

### Software Engineer and Researcher, passionate about applying deep learning and computer vision to build solutions with positive societal impact.

I'm a 4th year computer science + statistics major at UC Davis. Ever since I was a kid, I have been extremely passionate about technology and how it could be used to solve the problems around me. Motivated by this goal, I co-founded Komma as the CTO in my freshman year of college with three of my best friends with the goal of simplifying the way sales representatives schedule meetings. Energized by the experience of iteratively building products and features to solve customer problems, I became the Founding President of CodeLab, a UC Davis student-run software and design agency with 60+ members, where we consult software projects for high growth startups. 

After joining Twitch/Amazon as a Machine Learning Intern and conducting undergraduate Machine Learning research at both UC Davis and Stanford University, I became passionate and excited about a new tool: Machine Learning. More specifically, I am interested in applying cutting-edge deep learning and computer vision techniques to solve important problems. 

## Experiences + Projects

- Twitch/Amazon 3x Intern
  - 2022 (Applied Science): Developed novel unsupervised continual learning framework on streaming data.

  - 2021 Fall (Software Engineer): Designed & developed an end-to-end, real-time Media Analysis Service utilizing various services, and solving downstream tasks with the help of my trained Image Embedding to moderate Twitchâ€™s 9.36M+ streamersâ€™ content.

  - 2021 Summer (Applied Science): Developed a novel Twitch content representation Image Embedding trained using self-supervised learning

- Research Intern @ UC Davis, working under Dr. Hamed Pirsiavash. Designing a novel self-supervised, multi-modal action recognition and segmentation computer vision model architecture.

- Research Intern @ Stanford University, working under Dr. Dennis Wall and Dr. Peter Washington. 1. Developed Deep Learning-Based Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection Using Emotion Features From Video Recordings. Submitted paper to JMIR journal in the review process. 2. Contributed to Facial Emotion Dataset, "TikTok for Good: Creating a Diverse Emotion Expression Database" published in CVPR 2022.

- Codelab, a UC Davis student organization that builds software for high-growth startups. Cofounder/President where I grew organization from 7 members to 30+ within a year and which now has grown into 60+ members. Reached out to hundreds of startups prior to each cohort, negotiated project scope and needs, and finalized agreements with startup clients. Led weekly meetings with CodeLab leadership to reinforce direction, improve student member experience, and ensure project completion for our clients. Project Mentor for CodeLab's ReFocus AI, Family Proud, and Ambii client startup teams. Collaborated with company leadership regularly to ensure CodeLab met their needs. Successfully delivered high quality projects that exceeded startup client expectations.

- Komma, a web app which simplifies the way sales representatives schedule meetings. As Co-Founder/CTO, I led development of full-stack web application using React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, GCP, & AWS. Communicated with customers regularly for feedback & implemented necessary improvements. Released application as Beta, but eventually halted the project as we struggled to find product-market fit. Learned a lot along the process.

- Haven, a full-stack web project to connect cyclists with great businesses and places across their city. Logged-in users can search, review & rate local places. Built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Google Places & Auth API, MongoDb Atlas, and AWS.
